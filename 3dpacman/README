pman_faces.obj:
Pac-Man with a small number of faces such that if we were to use this obj file we would see the faces on his body.

pman_smooth.obj:
In an attempt to not show the faces, we selected the "Smooth Groups" option in Blender when exporting the obj file. Using this obj file, we cannot see the faces on Pac-Man, however because there are not a lot of faces the mouth appears to be very jaggedy.

medium_faces.obj:
This Pac-Man uses 4x as many faces as pman_faces. You can still see the individual faces using this obj file, but it is not as prominent.

medium_smooth.obj:
In a similar situation, we attempted to smooth out Pac-Man, and while it is successful in smoothing out the body, Pac-Man's mouth is still jaggedy.

more_faces.obj:
This Pac-Man has 4x as many faces as medium_faces, so the faces are not as visible on Pac-Man. However, because there are so many faces in this file, the runtime is a lot slower. 

more_smooth.obj:
Similarly, this obj file was successful in smoothing out the body and because there are more faces the mouth is not as jaggedy. However, the response of the keyboard functions using this obj file is slow.
