3D Pac-man with random terrain generation and smoothing.

# Contributions
Annalise worked on building a 2D and 3D Pac-Man using OpenGL. She also worked on creating the Pac-Man obj file using Blender, as well as creating the GLSL toon shader and phong shader for 3D Pac-Man.

Kevin worked on creating the randomly generated terrain using Perlin noise and FastNoise, coloring it based on height, creating the shaders for it, and putting Pac-Man into the scene to traverse over the terrain.
